# 🧬 Molina GenAI Platform Prototype

---

An end-to-end AI platform simulation aligned with Molina Healthcare's Generative AI vision — enabling secure, compliant deployment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM fine-tuning, and agentic workflows for clinical and administrative automation.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **RAG-Based QA System** – Simulates medical document Q&A  
- **LLM Fine-Tuning Pipeline** – Prepares task-specific models  
- **Agentic Workflow Engine** – Demonstrates autonomous care assistants  
- **Streamlit Frontend** – Web UI for interacting with models  
- **Colab Ready** – Explore, test, and demo notebooks with zero setup
